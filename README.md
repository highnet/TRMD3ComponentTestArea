# TRMD3ComponentTestArea

This is an auxiliary repository for testing UI components in a vacuum for the [Tiny-React-MD3](https://github.com/highnet/Tiny-React-MD3) project.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a testing area for UI components that are being developed for the Tiny-React-MD3 project. By testing these components in a vacuum, we can ensure that they are functioning as expected before integrating them into the main project.

## Usage

To use this repository, simply clone or download the code and open it in your preferred IDE. From there, you can create and test UI components in isolation, without worrying about how they will interact with the rest of the project.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome and encouraged. If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
